        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <div class="box1">
            <p3>Thank you for visiting my website! This website was created by me using HTML CSS and it 
                was created for you to learn more about me. <br><br>  
                Hello, my name is Ravee Chea I was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia but my family is from Cambodia. 
                I have a strong background in technology. I graduated from Georgia Gwinnett College with my Bachelor 
                of Science in management information systems with a minor in information technology. <br><br>  
                I hope to incorporate the skills I learned from my classes to my future employers. Skills such as PowerBi, 
                Powerpivot, Tableau, Mircrosoft office, Java, C#, Python, SQL, Agile, and Networking. <br> <br> 
                My PowerBI project will be under the projects tab. This is where I created a dashboard on who is the best 
                NBA basketball player since the 1960’s. As well as a SQL project where I created a database for an 
                airline, where I created entities, connected relationships between these tables, inserted data into 
                these tables, and writing queries to pull data from these tables.<br><br>   
                In my spare time I am someone who does not like staying still, I always have to be going out doing
                something. Whether it’s playing sports, hiking, camping, traveling, or fishing I enjoy being out 
                in nature and meeting new people. Some of my favorite sports to play are basketball, tennis, 
                volleyball, and pickleball. Also, some of my favorite places to hike would be Emerald trail 
                in Denver, Colorado, and blue ridge mountains here in Georgia. <br><br>  
                My goal is to apply my knowledge to help a company grow to greater heights, as well as learn as 
                much as I can from my managers and coworkers. I know I will be a great fit for any position 
                because I am a fast learner, and I am able to adapt to my surroundings.
